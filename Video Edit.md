# Download and Installation of DaVinci Resolve and the media page


 Video editing is a useful skill which aids in better storytelling through better aesthetically pleasing edits, more clarity, effects, sound correction, addition of elements,trimming of unnecessary parts, etc.

\
 Let's begin this journey to learn this skill of video editing.

\
 We will be using DaVinci Resolve, one of the most popular and user-friendly video editing softwares, which is also an open source software. So, without any further ado, let's begin.


# Installation of  DaVinci Resolve
 Our first step would be downloading the software. For this all you need to do is, look up for DaVinci Resolve in your web browser and then you should be able to see a number of results for this search. Open the website with the title blackmagic design or just simply click this link: [https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/in/products/davinciresolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/in/products/davinciresolve)

\
 Click on free download and download the DaVinci Resolve and not DaVinci Resolve Studio based on your particular operating system. And thus the installation part is done.

## Understanding the Media Page
 Now, when you first open DaVinci Resolve, you must be able to see a screen with no edited videos under projects, except something named as 'untitled project'. On the right bottom corner you should be able to see 'new project' and 'open'. Click on 'new project'.

\
 As soon as you click on 'new project', a new screen should be opened and you most probably be able to see the cut interface. But let's start with the media interface. To open the media interface, click on the logo at the bottom that is to the immediate left of the highlighted logo(indicating the currently open interface).

\
 You should be able to see the screen that is similar to the one  below.


 The media page or interface is used for importing the files that you would want to edit.

\
 On the left topmost corner, you have the DaVinci Resolve header. And when you click on that you see multiple options.'Preferences' allows you to modify the storage location in your system and also automatic backup timings, whereas, 'Keyboard Customization' allows the user to modify keyboard shortcuts for various functions and effects.

\
 Now, to import a certain file, all that you need to do is select the location of the file from the drives mentioned at the left top side of your screen. And when you have the desired file in front of you, just drag it and place it in the media pool section at the centre or you could also just right click in the media pool section and click on import media and then choose your file. You can also select multiple media files. 

\
 If there is some file which is being used multiple times and accessing it again and again by looking for it in the drives and folders, could be a tedious task, so selecting that file and adding it to favourites could make it easier and faster. This could be achieved by right clicking on the file, and then clicking on 'add to favourites'.

\
 Further, you could create timelines for a more organised process. If there are multiple timelines, you could also create a bin for a more organised process. Creating new timelines and bins is again only a right click in the media pool section away.

# Edit and the Cut Pages

Alright, now you’ve learnt how to set up DaVinci Resolve and how to import the media. Let's understand the editing interface.

\
DaVinci Resolve equips you with two editing interfaces, each excelling in different styles: the Edit page and the Cut page. Understanding their unique strengths helps you choose the optimal workflow for your project. Let's dive into a combined exploration:

## Why Audio is Important for Video

 Audio is an essential component of video production, as it can convey information, emotion, and atmosphere to your audience. Audio can also complement and reinforce your visual message, and create a more immersive and engaging experience for the viewers.
 
\
Imagine a sweeping landscape shot—the sun dipping below the horizon. Now, add a melancholic violin melody. Suddenly, the scene transcends pixels and becomes an emotion. Good audio has this power—it tugs at heartstrings, evokes nostalgia, and paints emotions in vivid hues.

\
Audio weaves the fabric of reality. It transports us—from echoing chambers to cosmic voids, from medieval castles to futuristic spaceships. Without it, the visuals remain mere snapshots; with it, we step into the frame

\
**Deliver**

So you've imported and organised your media, you've taken that media, organised it into a story on the cut and edit pages. You have worked on the color page, and you've worked on your images to create a visual continuity that supports the story. Then you've gone into the Fairlight page to mix your audio. Now it's time to take all of that work and render it out to share it with the world. 

\
The Delivery tab in DaVinci Resolve is your gateway to exporting your meticulously crafted video projects. Let’s unravel its secrets


## Tasks :
* Choose the video format for your export. Whether it’s MP4, MOV,or any other format of your choice 
* Set the resolution—1080p, 4K, or custom dimensions
* Optimization for Platform you are going to upload

\
